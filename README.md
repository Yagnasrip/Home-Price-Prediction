# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on **predicting house prices** using supervised machine learning techniques.  
Two regression models are implemented and compared:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

The goal is to analyze housing data, train models, and evaluate their performance in predicting accurate house prices.
